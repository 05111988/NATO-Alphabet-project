# NATO-Alphabet-project
This Python project converts words into their corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet codes. It uses pandas to read a CSV file containing letter-to-code mappings and then prompts the user to enter a word. The program outputs each letter as its NATO phonetic equivalent, ensuring accurate communication for spelling over radio, phone, or noisy channels.
